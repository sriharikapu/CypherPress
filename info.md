Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
CypherPress is a framework that lets you build decentralised databases for your organisation, team or even public. Your users will have control over who can access their data without a central authority managing those permissions.

An application of our platform would be to build a Dapp for doctors and patients in a hospital - where patients can decide who they want to share their medical history with.

Another application could be to build a 'decentralised-dropbox'.

Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)

IPFS - our decentralised storage service

ReactNative - our front-end framework
